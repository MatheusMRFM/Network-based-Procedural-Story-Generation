INTRODUCTION

    There are 2 folders in this project:

	- CODE:			Contains the code files of the proposed Network-based
					Procedural Story generation method. 
	
	- EXAMPLES:		Contains files with examples of stories generated through
					the proposed system by using different parameters.
				
COMPILATION GUIDELINES:
    
    - All projects uses a Makefile to compile. Therefore, to compile a 
    given project, simply go to the correct folder using a terminal and
    type 'make'. To clean the files generated through compilation, simply
    type 'make clean'.
    
    The executable created os called ProceduralStory. To execute it, just run:
    
    ./ProceduralStory
    
    Remember to ajust the parameters of the system by opening the main.cpp file
    and adjusting the indicated variables according to your needs.
    
EXECUTION GUIDELINES:

    When a story is generated, it is also created a file containing the social
    network created, following a graph description file. This file is saved
    in the Code/Output folder. This file can then be used within some graph 
    visualization tools, such as "Gephi".
